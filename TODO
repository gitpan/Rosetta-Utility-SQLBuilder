TODO

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta Developer Release #4.

* Update the list of 'standard routines' in SQLBuilder (and Rosetta::Model)
to more closely reflect the SQL:2003 standard, fill other gaps.

* Any further improvements will be implemented over time as they are
needed. See the separately released "Rosetta-Engine-Generic" and
"Rosetta-Emulator-DBI" distributions for a clue as they are the initial
main dependents of the Rosetta::Utility::SQLBuilder.
